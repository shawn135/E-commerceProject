This is an aws project to design a Scalable E-Commerce Platform with CI/CD and Monitoring. 
Project Overview

Build a cloud-native e-commerce platform that can handle high traffic, includes continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), and has robust monitoring. This project simulates a real-world scenario for businesses migrating to or building in the cloud.

Key Features

1. Scalability and High Availability:

Use AWS Auto Scaling for web and application servers.

Implement Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) for traffic distribution.

Deploy a multi-AZ RDS database (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL) for fault tolerance.

2. Microservices Architecture:

Create separate services for:

User authentication.

Product catalog.

Order processing.


Use Amazon ECS or AWS Lambda for deploying containerized microservices.


3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

Write infrastructure scripts using AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to automate resource provisioning.


4. Serverless Components:

Use Amazon S3 for static content hosting (e.g., images, CSS, JS).

Use AWS API Gateway to expose microservices endpoints.

Deploy AWS Lambda functions for event-driven tasks (e.g., order confirmation emails).


5. CI/CD Pipeline:

Set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.

Automate testing and deployment of microservices.


6. Monitoring and Logging:

Use Amazon CloudWatch for application and infrastructure monitoring.

Integrate AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing.

Store and analyze logs with AWS CloudTrail or Amazon OpenSearch Service.


7. Security:

Implement IAM roles and policies to follow the principle of least privilege.

Use AWS WAF to protect against common web attacks.

Set up Amazon GuardDuty for threat detection.


8. Cost Optimization:

Use AWS Cost Explorer and Budgets to track expenses.

Implement reserved instances or spot instances where appropriate.
